# PyleoTutorials
A collection of science-driven tutorials for using the [Pyleoclim](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util) Python package.

## Contents
The _notebooks_ folder contains [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) that illustrate the main classes of the [Pyleoclim user interface](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/core/api.html), using data hosted either in the Cloud or in the _data_ directory.

The notebooks are organized in three levels:
- **Level 0**: basic tutorials to understand the main classes and their uses, requiring minimal knowledge of Python
- **Level 1**: more advanced tutorials involving customization and more knowledge of Python
- **Level 2**: tutorials involving more advanced data analysis techniques, requiring some knowledge to apply and interpret properly.  


## How to run these notebooks

### Local installation
Use the environment.yml file with conda to install the required packages within an anaconda or miniconda installation. https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html

### Using the LinkedEarth JupyterHub
If you have access to a decent internet connection and do not want to install Python and Pyleoclim on your machine, the best option is to run these notebooks on the [LinkedEarth JupyterHub](https://linkedearth.2i2c.cloud/)
